    A wide import spans years DATASUS never published for a given UF. Before
    tolerance, the first such gap raised and discarded every result already
    collected — including scopes whose rows were already committed — so a
    702-scope run died on scope 3 with no partial results and no resume.

    Three filters keep work off the wire, cheapest first:

    1. ``coverage`` rejects scopes outside the dataset's declared window
       (``outside_coverage``) without asking the server for them.
    2. The listing: one fresh LIST per directory of the row per run. A scope
       the listing lacks is ``skipped`` (``not_listed``) without a download; a
       550 on a listed file, like any fetch error that exhausts its retry
       budget, is ``failed`` (``fetch_failed``) and worth retrying.
    3. With ``policy="skip_same"``, a scope whose publication recorded the same
       files (path, size, server time) under the same parser version is
       ``skipped`` (``unchanged``) without a download. Any difference downloads,
       and the publication then compares SHA-256 as before.

    Shape: ``concurrency`` fetches in flight, **one** consumer parsing and
    sinking, with commits every ``batch_size`` scopes. Fetch and parse used to
    be fully serialized — connect, RETR, parse, insert, one at a time — so
    wall clock was ``sum(fetch) + sum(parse+sink)``.

    ``max_inflight_bytes`` is a budget over the *listed* sizes: before
    fetching, each producer reserves the sum of its scope's file sizes (all of
    a split month's parts in one step, so no scope ever waits holding part of
    the budget) and holds it until the consumer releases the compressed
    payloads. A scope whose file is listed larger than ``max_payload_bytes``,
    or whose total exceeds ``max_inflight_bytes``, is ``failed``
    (``fetch_failed``) without a download, and the reason names the limit to
    raise. The fetcher also enforces ``max_payload_bytes`` during receipt.
    This is not a total RSS limit: decompressed DBF and parsing memory are
    additional.

# Release procedure

## Native package

`native/omnisus-dbf` provides the Rust DBF reader and DBC decompressor. It
builds independently of the main Hatchling package. Its version has one home
in `Cargo.toml`; Maturin exposes that version to Python. The pinned toolchain
and `Cargo.lock` are committed. Build with:

```bash
uv build native/omnisus-dbf --wheel --out-dir dist/native
uv build native/omnisus-dbf --sdist --out-dir dist/native
```

One abi3 wheel per platform (Linux x86_64, Windows x86_64, macOS arm64/x86_64)
serves CPython 3.12 and later; it is smoke-tested on 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14. The
`native.yml` workflow produces tested artifacts on pull requests and main pushes
that change native-related paths (listed in its triggers), on manual dispatch and on
`dbf-v*` tags, and `release.yml` runs it for every `v*` tag to test the native
wheels at the tagged commit. Only a `dbf-v*` tag publishes them (below). Every
native-only installation must use binary dependencies and pass outside the
checkout.

`omnisus` depends on `omnisus-dbf` from PyPI on the platforms with a wheel
(Linux x86_64, macOS, Windows x86_64) and decodes DBF and DBC in pure Python
elsewhere. The main wheel stays `py3-none-any`.

A `dbf-v<version>` tag publishes the native wheels and sdist to PyPI from
`native.yml` once repository variable `PUBLISH_DBF_TO_PYPI` equals `true` and
its Trusted Publisher exists (project `omnisus-dbf`, owner `raphaelfh`,
repository `omnisus`, workflow `native.yml`, environment `pypi-dbf`); the job
checks the tag against `Cargo.toml` and publishes only artifacts that passed
the complete matrix. `v<version>` continues to identify the main package. Raise
the main package's `omnisus-dbf` lower bound and `uv.lock` only after the new
native version is on PyPI; an unpublished dependency must not break installs.
`omnisus` accepts exactly one `API_VERSION` and caps `omnisus-dbf` below its next
minor (`<0.3`). Change `API_VERSION` only in a new minor of `omnisus-dbf`, and only
after an `omnisus` that accepts it and caps the following minor is on PyPI. Published
`omnisus` 0.2.0 has no cap, so an `omnisus-dbf` 0.2.x with another `API_VERSION`
would break fresh installs of it.

## Main Python package

A `v<version>` tag publishes `omnisus` to PyPI. Preparing a local artifact does
not publish it or authorize a tag/push.

```bash
uv build --wheel --sdist --out-dir dist
```

The version has one home, `src/omnisus/_version.py`. Update the changelog and
lockfile with it, and the `omnisus==<version>` pin that `notebooks/colab.ipynb`
and the PEP 723 header of every notebook install (tests check both). The docs
site reads the version at build time and is deployed only by a `v*` tag
(`docs.yml`), so it describes the release on PyPI; the `github-pages`
environment allows `v*` tags. Validate the candidate wheel outside the
checkout, including public metadata, packaged evidence and analytical
projections, before release.

The notebooks pin a version that must already be on PyPI when `main` gets it,
so the tag comes before the merge:

1. Open the release PR: `_version.py`, the CHANGELOG (`## Unreleased` becomes
   `## v<version> — <date>`), the notebooks' pins and `uv.lock`. Regenerate
   `docs/datasets.md` (`uv run python scripts/gen_datasets_doc.py`): it names the
   version and links the dictionaries at the `v<version>` tag, so its `--check` fails
   until you do.
2. When its CI is green and the release is authorized, tag the PR's head commit
   and push only the tag:

   ```bash
   git tag -a v<version> -m "omnisus <version>" <head-sha>
   git push origin v<version>
   ```

   `release.yml` checks the tag against `_version.py`, builds wheel and sdist once
   (the `distribution` artifact, with checksums), installs that wheel binary-only
   on Python 3.12–3.14 on Linux, macOS and Windows, and only then runs `publish`.
3. Approve the `pypi` environment in the run. `publish` uploads through a Trusted
   Publisher (project `omnisus`, owner `raphaelfh`, repository `omnisus`, workflow
   `release.yml`, environment `pypi`) when repository variable `PUBLISH_TO_PYPI`
   equals `true`. No token is stored in this repo.
4. Check that `uv pip install omnisus==<version>` resolves.
5. Merge the PR with a merge commit, not a squash, so the tagged commit is on
   `main`. If the PR changes after tagging and nothing was published, delete the
   tag (`git push origin :v<version>`) and tag again.
6. Create the GitHub release with the CHANGELOG section as notes and the same
   artifacts:

   ```bash
   gh run download <run-id> -n distribution -D /tmp/omnisus-v<version>
   gh release create v<version> --title v<version> \
     --notes-file <(awk '/^## v<version>/{f=1;next} /^## v/{f=0} f' CHANGELOG.md) \
     /tmp/omnisus-v<version>/*
   ```

## Supported Python

`requires-python` is `>=3.12`. The wheel-only install gate in `test.yml` and
`release.yml` installs the built wheel with `--only-binary=:all:` on 3.12, 3.13
and 3.14 and must pass; no dependency needs a Rust toolchain.
